I am a Senior Research Scientist and Team Lead at [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/), specializing in 3D scene understanding to develop robust and versatile perception models that can infer rich representations of their environment from vision. My research spans generative modeling, implicit neural representations, 3D reconstruction, domain adaptation, and self-supervised learning, with a strong focus on generalization and real-world transfer. I earned my PhD from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), under the supervision of [Slobodan Ilic](https://campar.in.tum.de/Main/SlobodanIlic).
