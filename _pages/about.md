I am a machine learning research scientist at [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/) and a former PhD candidate at the [Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures, Technical University of Munich](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/SergeyZakharov) and [Siemens AG](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html). My research focuses on scene understanding and covers such topics as scalable 3D object detection, neural implicit representations, differentiable rendering, and domain adaptation.
