I am a Senior Research Scientist and Team Lead at [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/), specializing in 3D scene understanding. My research spans generative modeling, implicit neural representations, 3D object detection, domain adaptation, and self-supervised learning. I lead efforts in advancing foundational research and translating cutting-edge methods to real-world applications. I earned my PhD from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) under the supervision of [Slobodan Ilic](https://campar.in.tum.de/Main/SlobodanIlic), focusing on computer vision and 3D perception.
